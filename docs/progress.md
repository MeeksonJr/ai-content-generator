# Development Progress

## 2025-11-14

- Initialized Supabase helper refactor to align with Next.js 15 async cookies requirements and typed schema configuration.
- Migrated AI admin and generation APIs to the new helper, enforcing typed Supabase queries, centralized usage-limit defaults, and resilient usage-stat updates.
- Completed follow-up fixes: tightened remaining API typings, exported shared HuggingFace result types, removed inline styles/accessibility issues on the analytics dashboard, and updated logger usage for structured metadata.
